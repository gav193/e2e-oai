- 14.00-16.30 : [Read online references on short circuit analysis and class notes](https://www.omazaki.co.id/en/short-circuit-study-analysis/)

## 2025/05/09
**Short-term Goals**
1. Divide work contribution based on 9 analysis questions given
2. Make sure all resources are installed (MATLAB with Simulink and SimPowerSystems addons)

**Daily Logs**:
- 16.00-18.00 : Team consists of 4 active members, hence dividing 2 to 3 questions per person
  - Analysis on variations of load value, transmission lines, various fault conditions, transformer parameters, and design capacity
- 18.00-20.00 : Look up the components and resources needed within Simulink in MATLAB

## 2025/05/12
**Short-term Goals**
1. Create simulation file
2. Design electrical power grid according to specifications given
3. Prepare for variations for load flow analysis and short circuit analysis

**Daily Logs**:
- 12.00-13.00 : Create simulation file with MATLAB and import required assets
- 16.00-21.00 : [Design power grid with given specifications](https://github.com/bmw-ece-ntust/internship/blob/2025-TEEP-8-Gavin/docs/3.%20Final%20Projects/1.%20Electrical%20Power%20Systems/Power-Grid-Design.png)
  - Unclear specifications with generator power generation leading to finding power value with trial-and-error
  - Unclear specifications with trafo and line parameters leading to same problem
  - Value on one of the loads are not specified and need to be detailed on next consultation with assistant
  - Simulation load flow does not converge because of limited iterations

## 2025/05/13
