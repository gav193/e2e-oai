# Electrical Power Systems Project Plans
## 2025/05/07
Team Distribution and Discussion
- Read through given reference
- Personal research on load flow analysis and short circuit analysis

## 2025/05/10
Setup milestone for project
- Divide work contribution based on 9 analysis question
- Make sure all resources are installed (MATLAB with Simulink and SimPowerSystems addons)

## 2025/05/13
Design electrical power system simulation for testing
> Hypothetical "city B" with 4 power plants that works on different time sections to power 4 different loads
- Create Simulation File
- Design electrical power grid
- Prepare for variations for load flow analysis and short circuit analysis

## 2025/05/14 
Prepare for IEEE paper
- Divide work contribution for team on parts of paper to work on
- Write Theoritical Basis, Introduction, and several other parts within the paper
- Continue working on simulation and variations to answer analysis questions

## 2025/05/16
First Consultation
- Meet up with lab assistants to consult on the project progress
