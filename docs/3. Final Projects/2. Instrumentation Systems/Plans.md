# Instrumentation Systems Project Plans
## 2025/05/05
Team Distribution and Discussion
- Read through given reference
- Personal research to find a topic based on given specifications :
  - Topic has to be based on a day-to-day problem that can be solved
  - Product uses analog sensor and a signal processing circuit (filter and amplifier)
  - Product needs to have a "useful" outcome
  - Follows 5 steps of engineering design (Problem definition, Specification setting, Alternative designs, Criteria for implementation, Testing and validation)
  - Conclude insights and give recommendations
  - Reference List

## 2025/05/06
Progress Report
- Make a document on word detailing the topic, team, short description, and the problem to solve with instrumentation system
- Divide work contribution on the topic and research on topic

## 2025/05/11
- Prepare outline for IEEE paper based on the specifications given

## 2025/05/13 
- Meet up with team and discuss technical ideas to create the product (Body Posture Monitoring System)
- Brainstorm on analog sensors and how it can be applied to the product to detect movement within the torso

## 2025/05/15 
- Research on the aforementioned components and implementations
- Continue on IEEE paper

## 2025/05/18
- Design circuit with sensors and its processing circuit

## 2025/05/22
- Test circuit design on a physical breadboard as a prototype
- Analyze problems and what worked according to design

## 2025/05/23
- Find countermeasures for the problems found during prototyping
- Simulate the new design

## 2025/05/26 
- Test new design prototype
