# Control Systems Project Plans
## 2025/05/06
Team distribution and topic selection
- Read through given reference
- Divide team's work contribution
- Find a topic or real scenario that involves a control system

## 2025/05/09
- Ensure the system involves mechanical, electrical, mechatronic, thermal, or other dynamic systems
- Crosscheck with other teams to make sure no topics clashed

## 2025/05/12
- Create the IEEE paper outline for documentation
- Design the mathematical model of the system including the transfer function and state-space representation

## 2025/05/20
- Analyze the stability of the system with Root Locus, Bode Plot, and Nyquist Criterion
- Evaluate the performance of the system (steady-state error, transient response, stability margins)
- Simulate the system's characteristic within a software (MATLAB)

## 2025/05/27
- Design the feedback control to achieve a set criteria for the system's performance
- Set control parameters (gain, time constant, etc.) to optimize the system's performance

## 2025/05/29
- Convert the system from continuous time to discrete time
- Re-model, analyze, and design the control system for discrete time
- Analyze and compare the results from continuous time and discrete time

## 2025/06/03
- Draw relevant plots (system response, stability plots, frequency response plots)
- Analyze the difference between system characteristics in continuous and discrete time
- Analyze the effect of discretization within a system performance
